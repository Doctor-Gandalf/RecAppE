# RecAppE
App designed for helping to make shopping lists from recipes.

Built and tested on OSX 10.10.4 using Python 3.4.3.
Will probably run on Linux as long as Python 3 is installed, but due to using Curses will probably not run on Windows.

Interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3, if otherwise either modify RecAppE appropriately
or run using python3 instead of open.
To run, open RecAppE (either by running python3 or opening).
To close, press 'q'.

Known problems:
- Resizing window causes undefined behavior or crashes.
